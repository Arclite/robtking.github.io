As I've been working my way through the Android track on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home), I've completed a basic weather app called Stormy that is now published on the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apptreatsllc.stormy). It is be free, and you can find the public GitHub source [here](https://github.com/RobTKing/Stormy).

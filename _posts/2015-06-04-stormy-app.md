As I've been working my way through the Android track on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home), I've completed a basic weather app called Stormy that is now ready to be uploaded to the Google Play Store. It will be free, and you can find the public GitHub source [here](https://github.com/RobTKing/Stormy).
